*READONLY is not finished yet

I wrote this project as my main pet-project. Here I use Angular framework to create Web-Application that uses AJAX.
It supports GET requests from server. Has a search tab, that redirects you to the book needed. Has slider with links to other sites. There are no real possibility to buy a book, every "buy" link redirects you to google.com.
